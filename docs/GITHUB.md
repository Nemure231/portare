## Why Github?

<p align="justify">
I know its kinda nonsense, because we are in github and i am telling you to sign up. But joke aside, before i start learning to code, i don't even 
know or want to sign up to github, because that what is beginner thinking. What i know before that time, github is just version control system for website,
not much. But time by time, i do realize i can connect my github into the hosting.

<p align="justify">
Hosting is the place where you can upload the website, so want i am talking about is you can make change of your file here, at github easily, and 
it will be change also in your hosting which is updating your website.
</p>

<p align="justify">
Its useful, especially for static website, and many hosting of course provide service to connect your website to github, 
Netlify also can do that.
