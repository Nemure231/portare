## Note
We are now going to install portare, in the import way. As i said before, you can make your website private or public, but the risk is you are
cannot receive some update verison from Portare. So lets get started.

1. Go to [Portare](../main/docs/GITHUB.md) Github, click the `Code` button, then in `HTTPS` tabs to copy the link.

3. Paste Portare git link in the `Your old repository's clone URL`, fill whatever in your `Repository Name`, then if you don't want people see your code choose `Private`, then click `Begin Import`
