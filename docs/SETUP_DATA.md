## Notice!
You must careful when edit the Data file, make sure you don't leave any typo in there. Or maybe you can edit your file somewhere else, i sugess you edit in [Codepen](https://codepen.io/pen/?editors=), because you can see the color of your code and make it easy to edit, and after you done with Codepen, you can paste again your code to your reporitory.

## Tips
And you are done, you can check your netlify dashboard to see the progress, after the progress is done, open your website. The deploy is success but your website logo still haven't change yet? You need to hard refresh your browser because your browser still store your old logo and old information, to do that just click `CTRL` + `SHIFT` + `R` in your website.
